= PHP-SQL-Parser Manual =
This is the manual for php-sql-parser, a pure PHP SQL parser with a focus on the MySQL dialect.

== How to integrate php-sql-parse into your application ==
The parser is a self contained class.  It does not require any PECL packages.  
----
   # Download the SQL parser file: http://php-sql-parser.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/php-sql-parser.php and place it into your include directory.
   # add *require_once*('php-sql-parser.php') to your application
   # Use the parser:
{{{
$parser = new PHPSQLParser();
$parsed = $parser->parse($sql);
print_r($parsed);
}}}

== Using the parser ==
The best way to see how to use the parser is to look at the examples, which you can get here:
   # Download the SQL parser file: http://php-sql-parser.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/example.php
   # Place it into the same location of php-sql-parse.php (if it isn't in your include path)
   # Execute the example:
{{{
php example.php
}}}
